Adds six new vanilla-friendly biomes.


Grasslands: Warm, with poor soil, lots of grass, and few trees.

Coastal Dunes: Low-lying sandy area with lots of water. 

Sandbar: Smooth, flat, sandy islands with little if any vegetation or arable land. Warning: It is possible (though unlikely) to get a sandbar map with NO solid land!

Alpine Meadow: A beautiful area with fertile soil, lots of flowers, and few predators.

Oasis: Desert with groundwater close to the surface, forming small lakes and pockets of rich soil with thick vegetation.

Iceberg: Frigid chunks of ice floating on the ocean. Who would want to live here?
